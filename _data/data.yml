    summary: |
      After a double bachelor degree at Clark University studying Economics and Computer Science, 
      I decided to further my education and interest in the field of Information Technology with a degree in MSIT from Clark in an Accelerated Degree Program.
      While a student at Clark I was very involved in campus and the local neighbourhood, holding a series of on campus job while simultaneosly occupying various levels of
      leadership positions in both cultural and performance based groups on campus.
      I am passionate about engaging in multicultural and diverse work environments given my own background as a Third Culture Kid, and ultimate goal is use the skills I've
      gained in IT and Economics to help further the economic and social development of my communities.
